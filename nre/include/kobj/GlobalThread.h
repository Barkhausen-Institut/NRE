 * call start() to bind a Sc to it and start it.
 *
 * If you create a global thread in your Pd (the default case), the GlobalThread and Sc objects
 * are managed automatically for you. That is, you call the static create() method to create a
 * GlobalThread and call start() afterwards. When the thread is finished, i.e. the thread-function
 * returns, it will destroy itself and the Sc as well. Note that this does also mean that you
 * should be careful when accessing a GlobalThread-object of a different thread. Because it will
 * be destroyed when the thread is done. So, basically, after the start() call you should leave
 * the object alone.
 * If you create a global thread for a different Pd, you have to manage the GlobalThread object
